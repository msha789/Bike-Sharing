# Bike-Sharing

## Overview 

The purpose of this project is to show investors insights from the bike-sharing model, bike rides analysis and how it works in NYC in order to demonstrate that running this model in Des Moines is a strong business proposal.

## Results 

- Top starting locations for rides. Shows concentration of where rides begin, mostly midtown.

- Top ending locations for rides. Shows concentration of where rides end, mostly midtown.

- Trip durations by count of bikes, by hour. Shows highest and lowest durations for rides. Most of the rides are under an hour.

- Checkout times for users by gender. This shows that males are the majority users who and the duration of their trips, typically under an hour.

- Trip by weekday by hour. Shows the distribution of highest and lowest traffic times which are weekday morning and evening rush hours.

- Trips by weekday by hour by gender. Shows that male users form a majority and have concentrations within weekday morning and evening rush hours.

- User trips bu gender by weekday. Shows that male subscribers are the most frequent users, especially during the week.

For further analysis more visualizations can be created to depict rides used per user type in locations. Some analysis on what kind of demogrpahic makeup or geographical characteristics go along with the type of users would be helpful for relocation of this model to predict success in certain areas versus others. Furthermore, more targetted analysis for gender specific data, such as only male-focused vsiuals might give more insight for targeted advertising to not only relocate and make a successful model in the new locaiton but also help further profitize the current New York model.
